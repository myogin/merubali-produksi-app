# Stock Movement and Product Logic Update Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the updates made to the StockMovement and Product logic to work with the new ProductionBatchItem structure after restructuring ProductionBatches from a single-entity to a header-detail pattern.

## Background

Previously, ProductionBatch contained individual production details (batch_code, product_id, qty_produced, etc.). After restructuring, ProductionBatch now serves as a header containing only shared information (po_number, production_date, notes), while individual production details are stored in ProductionBatchItem records.

## Files Modified

### 1. StockMovement Model (`laravel/app/Models/StockMovement.php`)

#### Changes Made:

- **Added new relationship**: `productionBatchItem()` to support the new ProductionBatchItem structure
- **Maintained backward compatibility**: Kept existing `productionBatch()` relationship for legacy data

#### Code Added:

```php
/**
 * Get the production batch item (for finished goods movements with new structure).
 */
public function productionBatchItem(): BelongsTo
{
    return $this->belongsTo(ProductionBatchItem::class, 'batch_id');
}
```

#### Impact:

- Stock movements can now properly reference ProductionBatchItem records
- Maintains compatibility with existing stock movement records that reference ProductionBatch
- Enables proper tracking of stock movements per individual batch item

### 2. CreateShipment Page (`laravel/app/Filament/Resources/Shipments/Pages/CreateShipment.php`)

#### Changes Made:

- **Updated imports**: Changed from `ProductionBatch` to `ProductionBatchItem`
- **Updated stock validation**: Modified `validateStockAvailability()` to work with ProductionBatchItem
- **Updated stock movement generation**: Modified `generateStockMovements()` to reference ProductionBatchItem

#### Key Changes:

**Stock Validation Logic:**

```php
// OLD: Using ProductionBatch
$batch = ProductionBatch::find($itemData['production_batch_id']);
$remainingStock = $batch->getRemainingStock();

// NEW: Using ProductionBatchItem
$batchItem = ProductionBatchItem::find($itemData['production_batch_item_id']);
$remainingStock = $batchItem->getRemainingStock();
```

**Stock Movement Generation:**

```php
// OLD: References to ProductionBatch
'item_id' => $item->productionBatch->product_id,
'batch_id' => $item->production_batch_id,
'notes' => "Shipment {$record->shipment_number} - Batch {$item->productionBatch->batch_code}",

// NEW: References to ProductionBatchItem
'item_id' => $item->productionBatchItem->product_id,
'batch_id' => $item->production_batch_item_id,
'notes' => "Shipment {$record->shipment_number} - Batch {$item->productionBatchItem->batch_code}",
```

#### Impact:

- Shipment creation now properly validates stock against individual ProductionBatchItem records
- Stock movements are correctly generated with references to ProductionBatchItem
- Maintains accurate inventory tracking per batch item

### 3. Product Model (`laravel/app/Models/Product.php`)

#### Changes Made:

- **Updated relationship**: Changed from `productionBatches()` to `productionBatchItems()`
- **Maintained stock calculation**: Kept existing `getCurrentStock()` method unchanged as it works with StockMovement records

#### Code Changes:

```php
// OLD: Relationship to ProductionBatch
public function productionBatches(): HasMany
{
    return $this->hasMany(ProductionBatch::class);
}

// NEW: Relationship to ProductionBatchItem
public function productionBatchItems(): HasMany
{
    return $this->hasMany(ProductionBatchItem::class);
}
```

#### Impact:

- Products can now access their individual production batch items directly
- Stock calculation remains accurate as it's based on StockMovement records
- Enables better tracking of production history per product

## Database Schema Impact

### StockMovement Table Structure

The `stock_movements` table structure remains unchanged:

- `batch_id` field now references `production_batch_items.id` for finished goods movements
- Existing records referencing `production_batches.id` remain valid for backward compatibility
- New records will reference `production_batch_items.id`

### Key Fields:

- `item_type`: 'packaging' or 'finished_goods'
- `item_id`: References `products.id` for finished goods, `packaging_items.id` for packaging
- `batch_id`: Now references `production_batch_items.id` for new finished goods movements
- `reference_type`: 'receipt', 'production', 'shipment'
- `reference_id`: References the source record (receipt, production_batch, shipment)

## Stock Movement Flow

### Production Process:

1. **Material Consumption**: Outbound movements for packaging materials

   - `item_type`: 'packaging'
   - `movement_type`: 'out'
   - `reference_type`: 'production'
   - `batch_id`: null (packaging doesn't have batches)

2. **Finished Goods Production**: Inbound movements for produced items
   - `item_type`: 'finished_goods'
   - `movement_type`: 'in'
   - `reference_type`: 'production'
   - `batch_id`: `production_batch_items.id`

### Shipment Process:

1. **Finished Goods Shipment**: Outbound movements for shipped items
   - `item_type`: 'finished_goods'
   - `movement_type`: 'out'
   - `reference_type`: 'shipment'
   - `batch_id`: `production_batch_items.id`

## Benefits of the Update

### 1. Improved Granularity

- Stock movements now track individual batch items instead of entire production batches
- Better traceability of specific batch codes and their stock levels

### 2. Enhanced Accuracy

- Stock validation is performed at the individual batch item level
- More precise inventory management and reporting

### 3. Better Integration

- Seamless integration with the new header-detail production batch structure
- Maintains consistency across all related modules (Production, Shipments, Stock)

### 4. Backward Compatibility

- Existing stock movement records remain valid
- Gradual migration possible without data loss

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Production Batch Creation

- Create production batches with multiple items
- Verify stock movements are generated for each item
- Check material consumption calculations

### 2. Shipment Creation

- Create shipments referencing individual batch items
- Verify stock validation works correctly
- Check outbound stock movements are generated

### 3. Stock Reporting

- Verify product stock calculations are accurate
- Check batch-level stock reporting
- Validate stock movement history

### 4. Data Integrity

- Ensure all relationships work correctly
- Verify foreign key constraints
- Check for any orphaned records

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Data:

- Existing `stock_movements` records with `batch_id` referencing `production_batches` remain valid
- New records will reference `production_batch_items`
- Consider running data migration scripts if full consistency is required

### For Future Development:

- Always use ProductionBatchItem for new stock movements involving finished goods
- Maintain the dual relationship structure in StockMovement model for flexibility
- Consider adding database constraints to ensure data integrity

## Conclusion

The stock movement and product logic has been successfully updated to work with the new ProductionBatchItem structure. The changes maintain backward compatibility while providing improved granularity and accuracy for inventory management. The system now properly tracks stock movements at the individual batch item level, enabling better traceability and more precise inventory control.
